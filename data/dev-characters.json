Taking part in his first swim-by shootout as a tadpole, Froggy seemed destined for a life of crime and prison.\n\nAfter a bloody gangwar with the neighbouring Toad-unit posse ended in a 5 year jail sentence, Froggy G vowed to end his gangsta ways. Instead, Froggy G started earning his keep as a beatboxing streetdancer and rapper, hoping to be picked up by a major record label. Unfortunately, his tracks titled \"Pond Pimpin\", \"Froggin' dirty\" and \"Motherfrogger bounce!\" didn't earn him much.\n\nIn order to make some money, and then make some mo', Froggy G became a hired gun. Combining his shoot-out experiences with lethal watery dance-moves and beatboxing techniques, Froggy G now spins and dashes across intergalactic battlefields, droppin foo's left and right with his fishgun, hoping to make some money to take his momma out of the hood.","icon":"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121003233921/awesomenauts/images/a/a3/Icon_Froggy.png","attacktype":"Short Range","role":"Brawler","wikiurl":"http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Froggy_G","image":"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005031513/awesomenauts/images/thumb/f/fd/FroggyG_Alpha.png/1000px-FroggyG_Alpha.png","beta":"0","rowNumber":1},{"name":"Sheriff Lonestar","description":"At the heart of the milky way lies the Bovinion system, ruled by a semi intelligent cow-like species.

Naughty Bovinion calves would, as the story went, be caught by this cowboy's unrelenting lasso.\n\nRecently, a wealthy Bovinian visionary opened up a park where visitors would come to see a genetically re-engineered cowboy in action. But disaster struck and the cowboy escaped his cage. Before the Bovinions could react the cowboy had wrangled the entire park staff. Terror shook the Bovinion civilization as the cowboy started to wrangle every single Bovinion on the planet! Suddenly the Bovinions found themselves out of their cities and wrangled into herds on green meadows by the whisky drinking, bucket spitting, yeeehaawing horror.\n\nOnce the entire Bovinian civilization had been wrangled, the cowboy, naming himself Sherriff Lonestar, rode a rocketship into the sunset, his job complete.
